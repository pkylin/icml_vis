We present visualizations of two examples to facilitate a comparative analysis of the completeness of the model's abnormal event predictions, both with and without the integration of our novel Gaussian Mixture Prior-based (GMP) Local Consistency Learning mechanism. We observe that the model with GMP predicts more complete abnormal event intervals.
